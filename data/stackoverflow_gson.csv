If I were modeling a haystack, I might implement it as a collection -- but as a collection of hay or straw -- not a collection of needles!  However, I would take into consideration that stuff does get lost in a haystack, but I know nothing about what exactly that stuff.  I think it's better to not make the haystack look for items in itself (how smart is a haystack anyway).  The right approach to me is to have the haystack present a collection of things that are in it, but are not straw or hay or whatever gives a haystack its essence.

There's actually more I was going to type and abstract into interfaces and then I realized how crazy I was getting.  Felt like I was in a CS class in college... :P

UPDATE: I've decided to accept Stevemegson's since his answer was the actual cause to my problem. But I'd like to share with yo a few alterantives I've found to this problem.
Stevemegson's Answer:
All I had to do was to change to a POST request and set the request header to JSON,that solved my problem on requesting Page Methods, but now I'm haing a hard time on handling the Response (I'll say more about that on another question).
Here's the right code to get this stuff:

Brendan's Answer: Through Brendan's answer I did a little research on the ICallBack Interface and the ICallBackEventHandler. To my surprise that's a way to develop aspx pages using Microsoft's implementation of AJAX Request's. This turns out to be a really interesting solution, since it dosen't require any JS Library to work out and it's inside .Net Framework and I believe that only a few people know about this stuff (at least those that are around me didn't know about it at all).
If you wanna know more abou ICallBack check this link text on MS or just copy and paste Brendan's answer.
A Third Solution:  Another solution I found was to instead of creating ASPX pages to handle my server side code I would implement HTML pages and call ASHX files that would do the same thing but they would use less bandwith than an ASPX page. One great about this solution is that I maged to make it work with POST and GET requisitions. Below is the code.
ASHX Code:

JavaScript File:

With any of these three options we can make asynchronous calls without use JQuery, using our own Javacript or using the resources Microsoft embeeded on .Net Framework. 
I hope this helps our some of you.

EDIT: From stevemegson in the comments

A static factory can also return null, and can more easily return an instance that it got from cache. Many of my classes have a static FromId(int) to get an instance from a primary key, returning an existing cached instance if we have one.

I want to be able to create a list of objects to send to the server and be properly marshalled into Java but the format that XStream and JSON expect it in is very non-intuitive and requires our javascript libraries to jump through hoops.
[EDIT Update issues using GSON library]
I attempted to use the GSON library but it cannot deserialize concrete objects when I only have it expect generic super classes (XStream and Jettison handles this because type information is baked into the serialization). 
GSON FAQ states Collection Limitation:

Collections Limitations
Can serialize collection of arbitrary objects but can not deserialize from it
Because there is no way for the user to indicate the type of the resulting object
While deserializing, Collection must be of a specific generic type

Maybe I'm using bad java practices but how would I go about building a JSON to Java messaging framework that sent/received various concrete Message objects in JSON format?
For example this fails:

Here's an example, I want to send a list of 3 Message objects, 2 are of the same type and the 3rd is a different type.

Intuitively I expect the XStream JSON to be serialized (and able to deserialize correctly) from the following format:

Instead XStream creates a single element list with fields that are named the classnames and nested arrays of Objects of the same type.

The trouble may be caused by it using the XStream XML CollectionConverter?
Does anyone have a suggestion for a good JSON Java object serialization that allows you to read/write arbitrary Java objects. I looked at the Jackson Java JSON Processor but when you were reading in objects from a stream you had to specify what type of object it was unlike XStream where it will read in any object (because the serialized  XStream JSON contains class name information).

That works ok if XML is your primary data format, and you just need some rudimentary JSON(-like) support.
To get good JSON-support, I would consider using a JSON processing library that does real OJM mapping (I assume Svenson does too, but additionally), such as:

Jackson
Google-gson

Also: even if you do need to support both XML and JSON, you are IMO better off using separate libraries for these tasks -- objects (beans) to use on server-side need not be different, just serialization libs that convert to/from xml and json.

And then in the Service layer I'll have GetCityBlocksByOwner, where I utilize an extension method to get the city blocks owned by a specific person, say we just want Guido's blocks:

If we do a .ToList() in the repository it's going to execute the queries - that's going to be ridiculous since we don't know who's blocks we're getting at that level. So the question is, how do we do this efficiently?  
Let's assume there are 50000 block owners, and some 1000000 city blocks, loading all of them is not an option.  Using IQueryables won't work due to the nesting (without extreme hacking, at least that I'm aware of).

They are a documentation clue about what the author expects to be instantiated.(NB) ""+Foo"" means you expect Foo to have a value when the predicate is called. ""-Foo"" means you expect to Foo to be a variable when the predicate is called, and give it a value by the time it finishes. (kind of like input and output, if it helps to think that way)
Whenever you see a pair of predicates like sum/2 and sum/3, odds are the sum/2 one is like a wrapper to the sum/3 one which is doing something like an accumulator.
I didn't bother to make it print them out nicely. You can just query it directly in the Prolog command line:

Another thing that might be helpful, that I find with Prolog predicates, is that there are generally two kinds. One is one that simply checks if something is true. For this kind of predicate, you want everything else to fail. These don't tend to need to be recursive. 
Others will want to go through a range (of numbers or a list) and always return a result, even if it is 0 or []. For these types of predicates you need to use recursion and think about your base case.
HTH. 
NB: This is called ""mode"", and you can actually specify them and the compiler/interpreter will enforce them, but I personally just use them in documentation. Also tried to find a page with info about Prolog mode, but I can't find a good link. :(

1652937,"I implemented @diogoriba algorithm into code, with this result:

Finding the common prefix of the first two strings, and then comparing this with all following strings starting from the 3rd, and trim the common string if nothing common is found, wins in situations where there is more in common in the prefixes than different.
But bumperbox's original algorithm (except the bugfixes) wins where the strings have less in common in their prefix than different. Details in the code comments!

Another idea I implemented:
First check for the shortest string in the array, and use this for comparison rather than simply the first string. In the code, this is implemented with the custom written function arrayStrLenMin().

Can bring down iterations dramatically, but the function arrayStrLenMin() may itself cause ( more or less) iterations.
Simply starting with the length of first string in array seems quite clumsy, but may turn out effective, if arrayStrLenMin() needs many iterations.

Get the maximum common prefix of strings in an array with as little iterations as possible (PHP)

1680011,"I would vote for Json as well and then particularly Gson. It handles generic/parameterized objects very well.
Alternatively, you can also write a generic object converter which does all of the needed conversions with a little help of reflection, such as this example. But if your ""API"" require that this converter is to be published as an interface to the enduser, then I would only suggest to replace

by for example

so that one doesn't need to cast it afterwards.

Google Gson supports generics and nested beans. The  in JSON represents an array and should map to a Java collection such as  or just a plain Java array. The  in JSON represents an object and should map to a Java  or just some JavaBean class.
You have a JSON object with several properties of which the  property represents an array of nested objects of the very same type. This can be parsed with Gson the following way:

Fairly simple, isn't it? Just have a suitable JavaBean and call .
