I'm having trouble deserializing the following json array (Sorry for the size):

If I paste it into a json-viewer, I get this structure:

Now, the array containing the arrays with the coordinates has a variable size. So I figured that in java, this whole object whould be an array, containing a collection of arrays, with each array containing a . Something like

4889847,"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a serializable data interchange format intended to be machine- and human-readable.
JSON is defined by RFC 7159 which is completely language independent, but it uses conventions familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including c, c++, c#, java, javascript, perl, python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language to use with RESTful APIs or ajax. It is often used instead of xml because of its lightweight and compact structure.
Many programming languages provide methods for parsing a JSON-formatted text string into a native object and vice versa. For example, JavaScript in modern browsers and other environments includes the methods JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify().
The JSON format is based on two types of structures:

Collection of name/value pairs


An ordered list of values (more commonly referred to as an array)



JSON defines six types of values: null, numbers, strings, booleans, arrays and objects. With regard to objects, the order of members is not significant, and the behavior of a JSON parser when duplicate member names are encountered is undefined.
Note that JSON is not the same thing as JavaScript object literals. Rather, JSON is a common format to serialize from and deserialize to objects in most languages. For more information, see There is no such thing as a JSON object in JavaScript.
Shortly after it was created, JSON validation was added following the description set out by Douglas Crockford of json.org in RFC 4627. It has since been expanded to also validate both current competing JSON standards RFC 7159 and ECMA-404.

Advantages

JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format (no markup bloat)
JSON is language independent.
JSON is ""self-describing"" and easy to understand.
JSON can be natively understood by JavaScript parsers, including node.js


JSON libraries

Java: JSR 353 (JSONP), FasterXML Jackson, Google Gson, JSON-Java, or jsoniter

17199878,"Your data are there, they're just encoded as base64 for performance reasons (take a look to this comparison). What you pay for that is the overhead needed to decode it in the client (but you'll save a lot of bandwidth and then time).
I strongly suggest you keep them in that format (because it's much more compact than the plain JSON array representation). You can decode them in JavaScript using a simple library to encode/decode base64. For example this one.
If you really need to serialize your array in that way then change your serialization library (for example Gson serializes them in the way you need) or to customize library you're using. For example FlexJSON to customize serialization has a powerful mechanism called Transformers. Just write your own tranformer to override default  behavior for  implementing the same logic of  and you'll be done.
Edit
In your fiddle you're decoding to a string, algorithm isn't different to decode to an array, let's start to change decode function to this:

Please note that this is just an example to explain the algorithm, it doesn't perform any check, it doesn't remove padding and it's even terribly slow. A more decent solution would allocate the full array before (or to use an ) because final array size can be computed from input string length. Look here or here for complete implementation.
